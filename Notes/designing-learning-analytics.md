# Workshop 1 - Designing Learning Analytics 
 
## Existing Learning Analytics Tools 
 
* MOOC - Massive Online Open Courses 
 
* With MOOCs, it's hard to tell what the students are doing and how they are interacting with the course data 
* Popular analytics tools which examine: 
  * Student interaction with course content over time: Heatmaps and course enrollment statics over time 
  * Transitions between different courses and programs with students 
 
* With MOOCs, another issue is providing specialized student feedback: How can an instructor manage a course with thousands of enrolled students? 
* OnTask is a tool which instuctors can use 
* OnTask takes data in from multiple institutional data sources 
* OnTask takes the data in and forms a **Student Matrix** 
* The instructor can create "rules", basically scripts, that checks conditions against students within the matrix and perform certian actions when conditions are satisfied 
* OnTask provides multiple ways of importing data: You can use their web interface to upload data manually, or you can set up automatic integration with other pre-existing platforms 
* They also provide an API for others to build plugins from 
 
* The biggest challenge with MOOCs is **Low completion rates**
