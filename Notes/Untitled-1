* Activity 1: Who is your user?
  * Jennifer
  * Sessional Lecturer
  * She is her 30s
  * She teaches politcal sci, she is comfortable wiith technology
  * She doesn't know how to develop her course 
  * Her students are very diverse in their background and abilities
  * She is worried about the fact that because students are ready when they come into the course, they will fail
* Activity 3: Reframing the problem
  * Redesigning the course design experience for a professor who is struggling to understand and meet with the 
    skills and preferences of her student
* Activity 4: Drilling down the problem
  * The instructor needs to teach more introductory material than she would like to because her students are 
    surprisingly less skilled than she expected
  * The instructor needs to lower the standards of their courses to please their students in order to ensure that
    the students give their instructor
  * The instructor needs a better way of assessing their students abilities because (not-so-surprising insight)
    grades do not tell all
* Activity 5: Rapid Fire Brainstorming
  * How might we?
  * How might we provide assessment of students skills and abilities before we give them the greenlight
    to take a course?
  * How might we improve pre-course assessments 
  * How might we improve the roadmapping process for students to clearly outline our expectations of them
    and to prepare them for each step in their journey?
* Activity 6: Wide ideas sharing
  * Why don't we?
  * Why don't we take the Chinese Gao-Kao and make it annually every year?
  * Why don't we make the assessment a diagnosis and give suggestions based on the results
